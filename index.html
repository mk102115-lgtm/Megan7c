    <h1>Why I love Guineapigs</h1>
    <p>I love Guineapigs. <br>They are so small and fluffy.<br>They walk around so innocently.<br>  When they eat, it's so satistfying.<br> when they squeak, my ear turns golden.<br> <h1>how to keep their cage clean:</h1><p>Guineapigs need the toilet ALOT! And they only sleep around4 hours a day, so all they do is eat! but when you eat, you need the toilet. so Guineapigs cages are full of stinky things. But Guineapigs deserve a clean home too right? they need a clean cage with food prepared for them.<br> </p>
