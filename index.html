    <h1> Guineapigs</h1>
    <p>Guineapigs are so cute, small and fluffy. <br> they squeek, eat and walk around. <br> But they only sleep for 4 hours! <br> I love how Guineapigs eat healthily and are not fussy. <br> 
    They look so innocent but adorable at the same time. <br> I love how similar they are to potatoes. They are so round. </p>
