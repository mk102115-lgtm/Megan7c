    <h1>Why I love Guineapigs</h1>
    <p>Guineapigs are so cute, small and fluffy. <br> they squeek and eat and walk around. <br> but they only sleep for 4 hours! <br> I love how Guineapigs eat healthily and are not fussy. <br> 
    they look so innocent but adorable at the same time. <br> I love how similar they are to potatoes. they are so round> </p>
